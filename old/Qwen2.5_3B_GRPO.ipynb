        "### 🔹 Overview\n",
        "This code evaluates the performance of a language model on the **Medical-O1-Reasoning-SFT** dataset by generating responses to test questions and comparing them against ground-truth answers using standard NLP evaluation metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🔹 How It Works\n",
        "1. **Loads the test dataset**: Retrieves question-answer pairs for evaluation.\n",
        "2. **Generates responses using the model**: The model is prompted with test questions formatted using a predefined chat template.\n",
        "3. **Computes evaluation metrics**:\n",
        "   - **ROUGE Score**: Measures overlap between generated and reference text.\n",
        "   - **BLEU Score**: Measures n-gram similarity between model output and reference.\n",
        "   - **BERTScore**: Uses deep learning embeddings to assess semantic similarity.\n",
        "4. **Aggregates and displays evaluation results**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🔹 Evaluation Metrics\n",
        "| Metric      | Description |\n",
        "|-------------|-------------|\n",
        "| **ROUGE**   | Measures overlap between reference and generated text using recall-based F1 scores. Good for summarization tasks. |\n",
        "| **BLEU**    | Compares n-grams (word sequences) between generated and reference text, focusing on precision. Good for translation tasks. |\n",
        "| **BERTScore** | Uses transformer embeddings to compare semantic meaning rather than exact word overlap. More robust for open-ended generation. |\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🔹 Expected Output\n",
        "After running the code, you will see three scores:\n",
        "- **ROUGE Scores** (ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L)\n",
        "- **BLEU Score** (ranges from 0 to 1; higher is better)\n",
        "- **BERTScore F1** (semantic similarity; typically between 0.5 - 1.0)\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🔹 How to Interpret Results\n",
        "- **Higher scores** indicate better alignment between model predictions and ground-truth answers.\n",
        "- If **ROUGE and BLEU are low**, the model may struggle with **word overlap**.\n",
        "- If **BERTScore is high but ROUGE is low**, the model may be **paraphrasing well but not matching exact words**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🔹 Next Steps\n",
        "- **If performance is poor**, consider:\n",
        "  - Improving **prompt design** to get better model responses.\n",
        "  - **Fine-tuning the model** on more relevant medical datasets.\n",
        "  - Adjusting **sampling parameters** (e.g., `temperature`, `top_p`) for more diverse or deterministic responses.\n",
